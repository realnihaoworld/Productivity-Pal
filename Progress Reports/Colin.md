    Began 3d modeling robot body
    started looking for small size speaker module
24.04.12
    MicroBit has built in speaker so that is good
    researched LCD displays for microbit
    found document suggesting microbit may not have enough pins for TFT SPI protocol making it much
    link to documentation on MicroBit integration - https://grgsmiscellany.blogspot.com/2021/06/microbit-and-spi-display.html
    While its possible and a handmade library translated from adafruit to python is available using the TFT and controlling it with an arduino nano is preferred freeing up more pins 
    for other additions on the MicroBit
    ordered 2 inch LCD display to come in 24.04.16 at 15.37$
